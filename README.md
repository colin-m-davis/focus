# Focus

Focus is a straightforward implemenetation of the [Pomodoro Techinque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). When the browser loads the app, a 25-minute timer begins counting down. At the end of this "focus" period, a 5-minute "break" period begins automatically. At the end of this "break" period, another "focus" period begins, and so on.

I created the single-page app with [React](https://reactjs.org/), and hosted it with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Roadmap

As my intention is to omit any possible distractions for the user, I do not plan on adding many features. If you have any suggestions that would enhance the app's simple, calm atmosphere, please let me know.
